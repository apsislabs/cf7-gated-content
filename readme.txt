Gate files behind your Contact Form 7 forms.

== Description ==

Contact Form 7 Gated Content is a lead-capture extension for Contact Form 7. This plugin adds options to your CF7 forms to gate access to a file so users don't see a download button until after the form has been successfully submitted. Repeat visitors will be presented with the download button only, so repeat form submissions are not required.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What kinds of files can I gate? =

Anything that can be uploaded to the WordPress media library.

= Can the download button be customized? =

Yes! You can customize the output of the download box with CSS, or you can add this snippet to your theme\'s `functions.php` file:

<code>
function my_content_button($url, $button_text, $button_classes, $content)
{
  return "$button_text";
}

add_filter('wpcf7_gated_content_button', 'my_content_button', 10, 3);
</code>

= Can I disable the default CSS? =

Yes! The default CSS can be disabled on a per-form basis.

= Does this secure my files? =

**No!** Gating content does not secure it from outside access. While it does restrict visibility of a download link to those who have completed your form, it does nothing to make the file private. Anyone with the attachment link or a properly formatted cookie will be able to access your file.
