# Contact Form 7 Gated Content

Gate files behind your Contact Form 7 forms.

## Description

Contact Form 7 Gated Content is a lead-capture extension for Contact Form 7. This plugin adds options to your CF7 forms to gate access to a file so users don\'t see a download button until after the form has been successfully submitted. Repeat visitors will be presented with the download button only, so repeat form submissions are not required.

## Supported Versions

We support and test against CF7 versions 4.9, 5.0, and 5.1. Earlier or later versions may not behave as expected.

## Installation

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the contents of `/contact-form-7-gated-content/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the *Contact Form 7 Gated Content* Plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What kinds of files can I gate?

Anything that can be uploaded to the WordPress media library.

### Can the download button be customized?

Yes! You can customize the output of the download box with CSS, or you can add this snippet to your theme\'s `functions.php` file:

```php
function my_content_button($url, $button_text, $button_classes, $content)
{
  return "$button_text";
}

add_filter('wpcf7_gated_content_button', 'my_content_button', 10, 3);
```

### Can I disable the default CSS?

Yes! The default CSS can be disabled on a per-form basis.

### Does this secure my files?

**No!** Gating content does not secure it from outside access. While it does restrict visibility of a download link to those who have completed your form, it does nothing to make the file private. Anyone with the attachment link or a properly formatted cookie will be able to access your file.
